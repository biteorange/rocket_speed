============

Estimating landing speed of rockets from images using geometry (Project of CS268)

The program utilizes openCV in python to perform basic operations in computer vision:
- feature detection
- descriptor extraction
- finding correspondence
- reconstruction from two views

The program is rather simple and limited, but is a good reference for myself for using
openCV in python for computer vision tasks.
